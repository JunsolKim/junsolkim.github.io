Individuals have become empowered to challenge others' online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing opinion. Using Twitter data, here we show the consequences of individual misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In Twitter's new platform, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before the exposure. With collective misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from diverse information consumption. Detailed comparison suggests differences in toxicity, sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on the diversity of information consumption and mobility across the information ecosystem.","tags":null,"title":"Individual misinformation tagging reinforces echo chambers; Collective tagging does not","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junsol Kim","Byungkyu Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684195200,"objectID":"441678a10fd69ec8987b073861fd6cac","permalink":"https://JunsolKim.github.io/publication/2023_arxiv/","publishdate":"2023-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_arxiv/","section":"publication","summary":"How can we use large language models (LLMs) to augment surveys? This paper investigates three distinct applications of LLMs fine-tuned by nationally representative surveys for opinion prediction -- missing data imputation, retrodiction, and zero-shot prediction. We present a new methodological framework that incorporates neural embeddings of survey questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts to personalize LLMs in opinion prediction. Among 3,110 binarized opinions from 68,846 Americans in the General Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, our best models based on Alpaca-7b excels in missing data imputation (AUC = 0.87 for personal opinion prediction and ρ = 0.99 for public opinion prediction) and retrodiction (AUC = 0.86, ρ = 0.98). These remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support for same-sex marriage. However, the models show limited performance in a zero-shot prediction task (AUC = 0.73, ρ = 0.67), highlighting challenges presented by LLMs without human responses. Further, we find that the best models' accuracy is lower for individuals with low socioeconomic status, racial minorities, and non-partisan affiliations but higher for ideologically sorted opinions in contemporary periods. We discuss practical constraints, socio-demographic representation, and ethical concerns regarding individual autonomy and privacy when using LLMs for opinion prediction. This paper showcases a new approach for leveraging LLMs to enhance nationally representative surveys by predicting missing responses and trends.","tags":null,"title":"AI-Augmented Surveys: Leveraging Large Language Models for Opinion Prediction in Nationally Representative Surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoosik Youm","Junsol Kim","Seyul Kwak","Jeanyung Chey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612915200,"objectID":"f5cfcb6438426a790d13dbed5b1c373f","permalink":"https://JunsolKim.github.io/publication/2021_proc_b/","publishdate":"2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_proc_b/","section":"publication","summary":"To avoid polarization and maintain small-worldness in society, people who act as attitudinal brokers are critical. These people maintain social ties with people who have dissimilar and even incompatible attitudes. Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 139) and the complete social networks from two Korean villages (n = 1508), we investigated the individual-level neural capacity and social-level structural opportunity for attitudinal brokerage regarding gender role attitudes. First, using a connectome-based predictive model, we successfully identified the brain functional connectivity that predicts attitudinal diversity of respondents' social network members. Brain regions that contributed most to the prediction included mentalizing regions known to be recruited in reading and understanding others’ belief states. This result was corroborated by leave-one-out cross-validation, fivefold cross-validation and external validation where the brain connectivity identified in one village was used to predict the attitudinal diversity in another independent village. Second, the association between functional connectivity and attitudinal diversity of social network members was contingent on a specific position in a social network, namely, the structural brokerage position where people have ties with two people who are not otherwise connected.","tags":null,"title":"Neural and Social Correlates of Attitudinal Brokerage: Using the Complete Social Networks of Two Entire Villages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoosik Youm","Byungkyu Lee","Junsol Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611792000,"objectID":"5c11d22bd6d5dbd7a4d7f6e293ab1ae6","permalink":"https://JunsolKim.github.io/publication/2021_plos_one/","publishdate":"2021-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_plos_one/","section":"publication","summary":"Unlike many traditional measures of centrality based on paths that do not allow any repeated nodes or lines, we propose a new measure of centrality based on walks, walk-betweenness, that allows any number of repeated nodes or lines.

Walk-betweenness allows us to identify hidden bridging communities in Chicago that were essential in the transmission dynamics.

Functional connectomes?patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain?are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest?that is, in the absence of external stimuli?and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friends may be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.","tags":null,"title":"Similarity in functional brain connectivity at rest predicts interpersonal closeness in the social network of an entire village","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minji Bang","Junsol Kim","Suk Kyoon An","Yoosik Youm","Jeanyung Chey","Hyeon Chang Kim","Kyungmee Park","Kee Namkoong","Eun Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609113600,"objectID":"7b9c63ee7eb1f280ede28d9601ecbd97","permalink":"https://JunsolKim.github.io/publication/2019_bbi/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_bbi/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasing evidence suggests that systemic inflammation adversely affects social experiences and behaviors of older adults by changing the functional state of the brain.

Most studies of sleep misperception examine sleep underestimation by comparing the results of polysomnography conducted in a laboratory environment with patients’ sleep diary entries. We aimed to investigate psychosocial characteristics of adults who underestimated or overestimated sleep time in a nonclinical, middle-aged community-dwelling population. We collected one week of sleep data with wrist-worn accelerometers. We used egocentric social network analysis to analyze the effects of psychosocial factors. Among 4,060 study participants, 922 completed the accelerometer substudy. Underestimation was defined as an accelerometer-measured sleep time ≥ 6 h and a subjective sleep time \u003c 6 h. Overestimation was defined as an objective sleep time \u003c 6 h and a subjective sleep time ≥ 6 h. Psychosocial characteristics of the sleep misperception group were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. A total of 47 participants underestimated sleep time, and 420 overestimated sleep time. Regression analysis revealed that women, living with spouse, economic satisfaction, and bridging potential had protective effects against sleep underestimation. Blame from a spouse involved a 3.8-times higher risk of underestimation than the control group (p = 0.002). In men, discussing concerns with a spouse had a protective effect against underestimation (p \u003c 0.001). Economic satisfaction, feeling social network-based intimacy, and support from a spouse were associated with overestimation in women.
